# Tada

Tada is an interpreted language inspired by lisp and lua. It's name means
"tabular data" or "table data".

I've wanted to learn a lisp for a while now, but have never come further than
the absolute basics. Also, I've never created a proper programming language
before. So I decided to make one - inspired by my rudimentary understanding of
lisp, combined with a bit of lua tables.
